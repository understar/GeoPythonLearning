# Exercise 7: Plotting data in Python (10 points)

This week we'll put together our data analysis and plotting skills using pandas and Matplotlib to create visualizations.

## Completing the exercise

- **Exercise 7 is due by 17:00 on Friday, October 28, 2022**.
- **Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change**!
- **[Working in pairs](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/why-pairs.html) is optional on this exercise**. If you prefer to work alone, please be sure to inform the course assistants. Otherwise, and we will only grade the repository of the member of your pair that is responsible for this week's exercise.

## Where to find help

- Review the [materials for Lesson 7](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L7/overview.html)
- Check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L7/exercise-7.html#exercise-7-hints) if you're having trouble
- Take a look at the **[PEP 8 - Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)** if you are uncertain about **the style of your code**

## Before you start

### Clone the Exercise 7 repository

Before starting to work with the problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 7 repository (e.g., `exercise-7-htenkanen`) in the instance using Git as we saw in [**Lesson 2**](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github).

## Start working

Exercise 7 has two problems worth 10 points in total. 

 - [Problem 1: A scatter plot of random points (3 points)](Exercise-7-problem-1.ipynb)
 - [Problem 2: Plotting temperatures (7 points)](Exercise-7-problem-2.ipynb)
